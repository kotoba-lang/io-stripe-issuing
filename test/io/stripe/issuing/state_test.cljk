  "The state mapping, and specifically THE COLLISION, which is the thing this
  provider's docstring says is the point of the file.

  `core_test` checks that the mapping is complete, that every event is covered, and
  that the statuses it names are real Stripe statuses. What nothing asserted is the
  behaviour those declarations exist to protect:

    \"inactive\" means BOTH :issued and :blocked.

  One is a card that has never worked; the other is a card that was working and a
  human stopped it. A provider that read the state back from Stripe and answered
  :issued for a blocked card would let a caller \"activate\" a card someone
  deliberately blocked. `stripe->candidates` returning a SET is what prevents that,
  and until now no test would have noticed it being changed to return one value.

  Every expectation was measured from the namespace before being written down."
