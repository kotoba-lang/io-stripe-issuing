;; `kotoba/io/stripe/issuing/state.{kotoba,cljk}` against `io.stripe.issuing.state`.
;;
;; This guest is a TWO-MODULE graph, and that is the point of the test rather than
;; an inconvenience in it. `covers-every-event?` asks whether every lifecycle event
;; has a provider operation, and `stripe->candidates` has to consider every
;; lifecycle state; the oracle answers both by reading `kotoba.card.lifecycle`'s
;; public data. A guest that hard-coded those five states and four events would
;; turn both into a comparison of a constant against itself -- green, and empty.
;; So the guest requires the lifecycle guest and iterates its enumeration, and
;; `a-fifth-lifecycle-event-must-break-coverage` mutates the SIBLING source to
;; prove the reach is real.
;;
;; The sibling source is found through the CLASSPATH ENTRY of the card dependency,
;; not through a relative path. That is deliberate: it makes the guest source and
;; the JVM oracle come from the same checkout, so the two cannot drift apart, and
;; it works on the plain git path (gitlibs) as well as under `:dev`'s
;; `:local/root`. When it cannot be found the test REFUSES -- it does not skip,
;; because a skip and a pass would be the same green.
;;
;; The controls are named after the guesses they refuse:
;;
;;   `inactive-must-mean-both` -- "inactive" is :issued AND :blocked. A provider
;;   that answered one would tell a caller a deliberately-blocked card is merely
;;   un-activated, and the caller would then "activate" it.
;;
;;   `a-fifth-lifecycle-event-must-break-coverage` -- coverage is a cross-module
;;   read, not a local constant.
