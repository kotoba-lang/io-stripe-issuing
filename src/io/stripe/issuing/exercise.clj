  "Run the write paths against Stripe TEST MODE, once, and report what happened.

  This library's README has said from the first commit that every write path is
  unexercised -- the shapes were written from knowledge of the API because the tooling
  available exposed only read operations. That sentence cannot be removed by reasoning;
  it can only be removed by a run. This is the run, written so that saying yes to it is
  a small decision rather than a leap.

  WHY IT CANNOT TOUCH LIVE. `core/mode-mismatch` refuses any key whose own prefix
  disagrees with the mode, and this entry point hardcodes :test. A live key here is
  refused before a request is built, by the same check the provider uses -- not by a
  flag anyone can pass differently. There is no argument that makes this issue a real
  card.

  WHAT IT DOES, in order, stopping at the first refusal:

    create-cardholder!  a test cardholder
    issue-card!         a virtual card, which Stripe creates INACTIVE (= :issued)
    set-card-state!     :activate  -> active
    set-card-state!     :block     -> inactive
    set-card-state!     :close     -> canceled

  Every step prints the request it made and the answer it got, because the point is to
  learn whether the SHAPES are right -- a green run that printed nothing would leave the
  README's sentence just as unproven.

  It is not a test and is not in the suite: it needs a key and a network, and a suite
  that quietly did nothing without them would be worse than one that never claimed to.
