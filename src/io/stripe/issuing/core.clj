  "A live Stripe Issuing provider for kotoba.card.actuation.

  This is the layer that actually issues a card, and it is deliberately the only
  thing in this family that can: `kotoba.card.ports` is propose-only, and
  `kotoba.card.actuation` is the post-approval contract this implements. Same
  arrangement as kotoba-lang/drive (contract) + io-storj (provider): neither
  library depends on the other, and a host depends on both.

  WHAT IS AND IS NOT VERIFIED, because the difference decides how much you may
  trust this before running it:

    Verified against the live Stripe API spec on 2026-07-30 (2026-06-24.preview):
      - GET /v1/issuing/cards and /v1/issuing/cardholders exist
      - card status is one of active / inactive / canceled
      - card type is one of virtual / physical

    NOT verified through tooling, written from knowledge of the API:
      - the POST bodies (/v1/issuing/cardholders, /v1/issuing/cards) and the
        replacement_for / cancellation_reason fields
    The MCP surface available here exposes only read operations for Issuing, so the
    write shapes could not be checked the way the statuses were. Treat every write
    path as unexercised until it has run against Stripe TEST MODE. `mode` defaults
    to :test for exactly this reason and `live?` must be set deliberately.

  NO CREDENTIAL LIVES HERE. The secret key is read from an environment variable
  named by the caller, and never logged -- `describe` redacts it. The transport is
  injected, so the whole provider is testable without a network and without a key.

  Every write goes through `actuation/precheck` FIRST: an approval naming both who
  and what, plus a caller-supplied idempotency key. A provider that reached the
  network and then discovered the approval was unnamed would already have acted."
